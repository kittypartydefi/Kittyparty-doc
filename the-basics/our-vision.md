# Our Vision

## What is it exactly?

It works as a closed collective financial system with collective amounts stored on a DeFi platform in order to generate additional revenue. There will be multiple communities and in each community each member will deposit the round funds to confirm the contribution for the Party in the Round. What Kitty party does is that it locks all funds from the Kreator and all the Kittens. Here the Kreator is the one who creates the community and sends out invite link to friends, family, crypto-newbies. Kittens are the members within the community playing by the rules of the lossless lottery system. Once time reaches, Kitty Party automatically reimburses the Kitten depending on the Party (Community) Type.

Our ultimate aim is to grow each Party (community).

## What is Kitty Party's profit in this equation?

Kitty Party collects the round funds from each Kitten and Kreator in the party and places the funds in a staking incubator and from the profit earned, Kitty Party takes X% capped to a max of 2% - the rest goes to the users. Rewards are generated using existing [decentralized finance (DeFi) ](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/)platforms, such as Aave etc.
