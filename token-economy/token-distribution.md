| Distribution Criteria      | Distribution |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Product Development        | 10%          |
| Community Related Growth   | 20%          |
| Private Investments        | 10%          |
| Liquidity Provisioning     | 55%          |
| Social/Tech Grants         | 5%           |



We want to cater for long term growth and opportunities, a large Liquidity Provision will ensure distribution of tokens over time. Followed by community development and opportunities.

We start off by provision liquidity for 100 million tokens and <10K USD. We then provision a LP pool in uniswap v2, once this is completed we will then launch a token lock program for an additional $50 million token reward.

Further LP staking will be provisioned for $20 million KPT rewards. Another $30 million KPT will be distributed for early users of the DApp.

50% of the revenue from the DApp will be utilized to buy KPT tokens from the market and then lock it for a period of 5 years in batches. The balance will be added to the DAO treasury periodically.
